# Coronavirus Goes Viral: Quantifying the COVID-19 Misinformation Epidemic on Twitter

Twitter is a social media platform that allows users to share and receive short posts called tweets. Though it is often used for quickly spreading news and other updates, in more recent times it has been accused of being plagued by misinformation and bots. With the outbreak of the novel coronavirus Covid-19, Twitter has become an echo chamber of hoaxes and rumors on the virus, perpetuating more Covid-19 cases and deaths.
The Twitter API provides data scientists with a goldmine of unstructured data that can be analyzed using techniques from class to identify and classify various types of misinformation.
Our project utilizes Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Engineering, NLP (Natural Language Processing), & ML (Machine Learning) to classify tweets and even predict whether a tweet has misleading information.
In this regard, our project is a baby step towards eradicating harmful data on Twitter.
